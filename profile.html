		<h2>Level 0 - Prologue</h2>
		
		<p>
			Welcome to my profile. I was born and raised in the Bay Area. I was always interested in computers with a focus around games, but it turns out everything technical was interesting to me. The following is the journey to how I got into Dev Bootcamp.
		</p>

		<h2>Level 1 - Jr. Software Engineer?</h2>

		<p>
			This job lasted about a year. I didn't enjoy it, nor did I do enough to learn as much as I should've. Part of learning as you grow older. But then the dot com bubble bursts, and there goes the job. What to do next?
		</p>

		<h2>Level 2 - Game Tester to Designer</h2>

		<p>
			This is where I am now. It all started when I took a game testing job in 2002 and through some hard work and luck, I was able to work with our internal dev team as a game designer. Luckily, I got to work on these two titles with a talented team.

		<p>
			But the gaming landscape is shifting to a direction where only the biggest, baddest games survive, or the innovative indies are cherished. Those in the middle can't survive. So...
		</p>

		<h2>Level 3 - Back to Programming</h2>

		<p>
			This is this opportunity to jump back into programming through an intense course to become a web app developer. A second chance I wasn't sure I'd get, but what better way to come back to coding.
